These types can be used with the standard ``CAST`` operator.

BIGINT

    A 64-bit signed two's complement integer with a minimum value of
    ``-2^63`` and a maximum value of ``2^63 - 1``.

DOUBLE
------

    A double is a 64-bit inexact, variable-precision implementing the
    IEEE Standard 754 for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic.

    Example: ``TIME '01:02:03.456'``

TIME WITH TIME ZONE

    Time of day (hour, minute, second, millisecond) with a time zone.
    Values of this type are rendered using the time zone from the value.

TIMESTAMP
---------

    Instant in time that includes the date and time of day without a time zone.
    Values of this type are parsed and rendered in the session time zone.

    Example: ``TIMESTAMP '2001-08-22 03:04:05.321'``

TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
------------------------

    Instant in time that includes the date and time of day with a time zone.
    Values of this type are rendered using the time zone from the value.
